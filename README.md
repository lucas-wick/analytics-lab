# ðŸ“š Analytics Lab â€” Structured Learning Portfolio

This repository is my structured learning space for **Analytics, BI, SQL, Python, Machine Learning, AI Engineering, and Data Engineering**.  
Each folder contains themed projects with consistent structure and documentation.

## ðŸ“‚ Categories
- 01-excel-sheets â†’ Excel & Google Sheets
- 02-bi-tools â†’ BI Tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker)
- 03-sql â†’ SQL projects
- 04-python â†’ Python analytics

## ðŸ§­ Philosophy
Learning projects are documented as if they were professional deliverables.  
My **curated portfolio** will live in a separate repo (`portfolio-projects`).
