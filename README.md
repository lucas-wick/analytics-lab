# 📚 Analytics Lab — Structured Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Analytics Lab** — a structured and professional repository designed to showcase my journey and growth as a **Data Analyst and Data Scientist**.  

This space is not just a collection of exercises, but a **living laboratory** where I build, test, and document projects across the entire **data value chain**:  
from **data collection and cleaning** → to **analysis and visualization** → to **Machine Learning and AI Engineering** → and finally **data pipelines and cloud deployments**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives of this Repository
- ✅ Build a **well-structured learning portfolio**, with clear storytelling and business-oriented insights.  
- ✅ Demonstrate **technical breadth** (Excel, SQL, Python, BI, ML, AI, Data Engineering).  
- ✅ Develop **transferable, professional practices**: clean code, modular structure, and strong documentation.  
- ✅ Prepare a foundation for my **Top-Tier Portfolio** (curated projects that will live in a separate repo).

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into thematic folders. Each contains learning projects with a **consistent structure** (data, notebooks, code, reports, docs).

analytics-lab/

├── 01-excel-sheets/ → Excel & Google Sheets projects 

├── 02-bi-tools/ → Power BI, Tableau & Looker dashboards

├── 03-sql/ → SQL queries and case studies

├── 04-python/ → Python analytics and scripting

├── 05-ml/ → Machine Learning experiments

├── 06-ai-engineering/ → AI Engineering (LLMs, MLOps, Deployments)

├── 07-data-engineering/ → Data Engineering (ETL, pipelines, warehousing)

└── README.md → You are here

Each subfolder includes:
- **`data/`** → datasets (raw, sample, processed)  
- **`notebooks/`** → exploratory analyses and experiments  
- **`src/`** → source code, utilities, models  
- **`reports/`** → exported dashboards, visualizations, or metrics  
- **`docs/`** → guides, extra explanations, or Medium article drafts

## 🧭 Methodology & Philosophy
I treat every learning project as if it were a **real professional deliverable**:  
- 📖 **Clear documentation** with context, problem statement, and approach.  
- 📊 **Business storytelling**: insights always tied to decision-making.  
- 🧩 **Modular structure**: easy to navigate, reproducible, and scalable.  
- 🚀 **Professional practices**: Git conventions, versioning, clean commits.  

This approach ensures that my **learning phase already reflects industry standards**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

This repository explores a wide range of tools across the data ecosystem:

- **Spreadsheets** → Excel, Google Sheets  
- **BI & Visualization** → Power BI, Tableau, Looker  
- **Databases** → SQL (Postgres, MySQL, BigQuery, SQLite)  
- **Programming** → Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** → scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **AI Engineering** → LLMs, Prompt Engineering, LangChain, Deployments with Docker/Kubernetes  
- **Data Engineering** → Airflow, dbt, ETL pipelines, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## 📚 Learning vs. Portfolio Projects
- **Learning Projects (this repo):**  
  Smaller, exploratory projects created while studying different tools. Each is documented in a **professional way** so it still adds value.  

- **Portfolio Projects (separate repo):**  
  Selected top-tier projects with advanced storytelling, polished dashboards, and real-world case studies. These will represent my **professional portfolio**.  

---

## 📌 How to Navigate
- Start with the **category folder** (e.g., `01-excel-sheets/`).  
- Open the project folder (e.g., `sales-analysis/`).  
- Read the **README.md** inside → it contains:  
  - Business Question  
  - Approach  
  - Key Insights  
  - What I Learned  
- Explore supporting files in `data/`, `reports/`, and `docs/`.

✨ *This repository is a reflection of my belief that **learning should be documented and structured as if it were already work experience**. By combining technical skills, business storytelling, and professional organization, I aim to create value not only for myself but also for anyone exploring these projects.*
